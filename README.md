# ASE-code
 
* Dear reviewer, this is a demo for our model ASE and I think it can help you understand the mechanics of our framework.
* I am sorry that the provided code is a little messy since we wanted to be more efficient when we started writing our code. And since we completed our experiment a long time ago, it might not be the latest of our code but I think it will not affect your understanding of our framework.
